Awesome. Let's pick one high-impact feature to prototype first. Here's a suggestion based on your current app flow — you're already asking users for characters, setting, key action, style, and length.

Let’s enhance this with a **Scene-by-Scene Builder with a Story DNA Engine** — something exciting but still compatible with your current structure.

## ✨ Feature Prototype: **Scene-by-Scene Builder with Story DNA**

### 💡 Core Idea:

Instead of generating a full story at once, let the user guide the flow scene by scene — while the backend tracks plot structure and character arcs. Users can nudge the tone, pacing, or introduce twists as they go.

---

### 🔧 UI Flow Overview

**Step 1: Story Setup (same as current)**

* Main Character
* Secondary Character
* Location
* Key Action
* Style
* Length (Short / Medium / Long)

**+ Add this:**

* **Story Mood**: (Hopeful, Dark, Funny, Melancholic, Whimsical)
* **Conflict Type**: (vs Self, vs Others, vs Society, vs Nature)
* **Theme**: (Betrayal, Forgiveness, Growth, Survival)

**Step 2: Story Flow Preview (Optional outline)**

> "Based on your input, your story might look like this:"
>
> 1. Introduction: Meet the characters, normal world
> 2. Inciting Incident: A problem arises
> 3. Rising Action: Things get complicated
> 4. Climax: A major turning point
> 5. Resolution: Conflict resolved, ending tone

Let user **click any part** to start from there, or go linear.

**Step 3: Interactive Scene Generation**

On each screen:

📝 **\[Generated Scene Text]**

🔁 Regenerate | ✍️ Edit | 💬 Add Dialogue | ➕ Add Twist

✅ Continue to Next Scene

**Below it, add suggestions** like:

* 💡 “What if a hidden enemy is revealed?”
* 💡 “Let the main character make a mistake here”
* 💡 “Introduce a moral dilemma”

---

**Step 4: Story Summary & Export**

* Read as full story
* Download as `.txt` or `.pdf`
* Optionally save scene cards with beat notes
* Generate cover art from prompt (Stable Diffusion if integrated)

---

### 🔌 Prompt Structuring (API Example)

For **Scene 3: Rising Action**, the prompt to OpenAI might be:

```js
[
  { role: "system", content: "You are a creative story assistant. Write in [style] style." },
  { role: "user", content: `Continue the story. 
Characters: ${mainChar}, ${secChar}. 
Setting: ${setting}. 
Current plot summary: ${summarySoFar}. 
Current scene: Rising Action.
Tone: ${mood}. Theme: ${theme}. Conflict: ${conflictType}. 
Add tension. Do not resolve the conflict yet.` }
]
```

Would you like a **React component UI mockup** for this scene-by-scene builder? Or maybe a working **prompt system with state handling** for the scene generation logic in your wrapper?
